MemSQL Pipelines Meetup
=======================

1. Run the MemSQL quickstart docker image with the included schema file.

```bash
docker run -d -v $(PWD)/schema.sql:/schema.sql -p 3306:3306 -p 9000:9000 --name=memsql memsql/quickstart
```

2. Open up the MemSQL Ops UI at http://localhost:9000

3. On the pipeline page create the first Pipeline:

```
    Kafka Hostname: public-kafka.memcompute.com
    Kafka Topic: tweets

    Database: twitter
    Table: tweets
```

4. On the pipeline page create another pipeline, but upload the included
   transform.py file and use the `tweet_links` table.
